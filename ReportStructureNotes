Have You Done Your Job as a Writer?
As a data scientist, you are expected to do thorough analysis with the appropriate data, deploying the appropriate tools.
As a writer, you are responsible for communicating your findings to the readers.
Transport Policy, a leading research publication in transportation planning, offers a checklist for authors interested in publishing with the journal.
The checklist is a series of questions authors are expected to consider before submitting their manuscripts to the journal.
I believe the checklist is useful for budding data scientists and, therefore, I have reproduced it verbatim for their benefit.

* Have you told readers, at the outset, what they might gain by reading your paper?
* Have you made the aim of your work clear?
* Have you explained the significance of your contribution?
* Have you set your work in the appropriate context by giving sufficient background (including a complete set of relevant references) to your work?
* Have you addressed the question of practicality and usefulness?
* Have you identified future developments that might result from your work?
* Have you structured your paper in a clear and logical fashion?
